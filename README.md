## Setting Up Your Airflow Project

### Prerequisites:
1. **Install Docker:** Make sure you have the latest version of Docker installed on your computer. 
2. **Install Astro:** Astro is a platform that helps you build data pipelines. Install it following the instructions on the official Astro website.
3. **Install Airflow:** Airflow is a popular open-source platform for scheduling and monitoring data pipelines. You can install it using Astro or directly from the Airflow website.

### Creating the Project:

1. **Create a New Folder:** Create a new folder on your computer where you want to store your project files.
2. **Initialize Astro:** Open a terminal window in that folder and run the following command:
   ```bash
   astro dev init
   ```
   This will create a new Astro project with the necessary files and configurations.

### Writing the Airflow DAG:

1. **Create a Python File:** Create a new Python file in the `dags` folder of your project.
2. **Write Your Code:** In this file, you'll define the tasks for your data pipeline. These tasks will typically involve:
   - **Extracting data:** Fetching data from a source like an API or a database.
   - **Transforming data:** Cleaning, filtering, and manipulating the data.
   - **Loading data:** Storing the processed data in a target database or file system.

### Setting Up Docker Compose:

1. **Create a Docker Compose File:** Create a file named `docker-compose.yml` in your project's root directory.
2. **Configure Services:** In this file, you'll define the services (containers) for your Airflow environment, including the webserver, scheduler, and database.

### Starting the Airflow Environment:

1. **Run the Command:** In your terminal, run the following command:
   ```bash
   astro dev start
   ```
   This will start all the services defined in your `docker-compose.yml` file.
2. **Access Airflow UI:** Once the services are up and running, you can access the Airflow UI by opening a web browser and going to `http://localhost:8080`.
3. **Login to Airflow:** Use the default credentials: `admin` for both username and password.

### Setting Up Connections:

1. **Add Connections:** In the Airflow UI, go to the Admin section and add the necessary connections. You'll need connections for your data sources and targets, such as a database connection for PostgreSQL.

### Running the DAG:

1. **Trigger the DAG:** Once your connections are set up, you can trigger your DAG to run. This will execute the tasks you defined in your Python file.

### Monitoring the DAG:

1. **Check the DAG's Status:** In the Airflow UI, you can monitor the progress of your DAG and view the logs for each task.
2. **Verify Data:** Use a database tool like DBeaver to check the data that has been loaded into your database.

By following these steps, you can successfully set up and run your Airflow data pipelines.
